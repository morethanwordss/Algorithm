# Binary Exponentiation
## Introduction
Binary exponentiation is also known as exponentiation by squaring.

By using this trick we can calculate _a<sup>n</sup>_ in _O(log n)_ instead of _O(n)_.
## Algorithm
_a <sup>b + c</sup> = a <sup>b</sup> â€¢ a <sup>c</sup>_

_3<sup>13</sup> = 3<sup>1101<sub>2</sub></sup>_
