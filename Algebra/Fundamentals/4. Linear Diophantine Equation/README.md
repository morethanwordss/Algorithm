# Introduction
A Linear Diophantine Equation is an equation of the general form:
<pre>a.x + b.y = c </pre>
Where `a`, `b`, `c` are given integers, and `x`, `y` are unknown integers.

There are 4 classical problems on this equation, 
- Finding one solution
- Finding all solution
- Finding the number of solutions and the solutions themselves in a given interval
- finding a solution with minimum value of `x + y`
